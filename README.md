 This is the backend portion of the myFlix React and Angular Apps, which serves them both.  It was created with javascript with the use of express, node, mongoose, bodyparser, bcrypt, passport and cors. It consists mainly of four distinct files, auth.js, server.js, index.js and models.js which all work together to provide server, authentication, api requests and general app functionality.  This, along with the mongodb database in which it serves and the two front end portions(React and Angular) demonstrate the full stack process.
